"""The second variable-size worker's share of the e2e bridges (codegen/e2e_bridge.py imports it).

codegen/e2e_bridge.py owns the templates, the shared support modules (e2e_load, e2e_cap, e2e_emit,
e2e_ulist) and the manifest; this module only adds per-name entries and any new shared module:

  VDEC_VIEWS[X]   = {'view': 'RT.v_X', 'imports': [...], 'text': ...}   (ii)/(iii): the view lemma vv
  VROOT_SHAPES[X] = f(R, X) -> text                                     (iv): the rebuild from rep
  VENC_SHAPES[X]  = f(R, X) -> text                                     (i)
  SUPPORT_OUT     = {'e2e_<name>.bend': text}                           new shared modules
  VENC_PREMISE[X] = '...'                                               (i)'s premise text in the manifest

X is the generated name (api_map.json), R the readable one (names.py). A name counts as bridged in the
manifest's variable_size section once it has all three; see e2e_bridge's DataColumnsByRootIdentifier
entries for the pattern. Texts may import ../types/fulu_obj.bend as T: e2e_bridge rewires them.

The decode template reads from the name's decode facade: the decoder (T.<fn>), the object type
(Maybe<&1, ..>; override with VDEC_VIEWS[X]['otype']), the schema (Spec or GS), and whether OBJ / VAL
take the depth (OBJ(d, t, n)); it calls the view lemma with decode_accept's own hypotheses:
  vv(+d, +t, +n, +pf: perfect(d, t), +hd: d < bound, +hn: to_nat(n) <= quad(pow2(d)), +hchk: CHK(t, n) == True)
    -> {view(OBJ(..)) == VAL(..)}
