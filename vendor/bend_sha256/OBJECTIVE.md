# Objective: faster SHA-256 with the existing universal proof intact

Optimize the native Bend implementation of SHA-256. Preserve the public API's
behavior for every `List<&2, U32>`: each element contributes its low eight bits
and the result is the eight SHA-256 digest words in order. Preserve the existing
unconditional theorem `Laws.sha256_correct` against the independent `fips.bend`.
Also preserve the public 32-byte digest API and all its serialization, correctness
and length theorems. The benchmark measures the eight-word API.

## Measure

Run `uv run --frozen python research_validate.py` before benchmarking. Any failure
rejects the candidate. Then run `uv run --frozen python benchmark_sha256.py --gpu off`.
The final stdout line is JSON. The score is `best_bend_total_ms`: for each Bend
execution mode, sum its median batch times across 64-, 1,024-, 16,384-, and
65,536-byte messages. Select the lowest complete-suite total across sequential
CPU and parallel CPU. Do not mix the best per-size samples from different modes. Each
workload initially hashes 1 MiB of deterministic runtime-loaded binary data.
If any native warmup or sample takes less than 20 ms, the trusted harness doubles
the corpus for ALL workloads and modes and retries the entire suite, up to
64 MiB per workload. Short timing is a calibration signal, not evidence against
an optimization. Never abandon a faster architecture for triggering calibration.
All reported score times are normalized to 1 MiB; raw sample times, actual corpus
size and digest checks are retained. Use only the final complete calibrated report.
Each has an untimed warmup and five measured samples; every digest is checked.
Autoresearch repeats the complete benchmark three times and compares medians.

The Python leaderboard measures hashlib, PyCryptodome and cryptography. It is
context, not the optimization metric: slowing down a reference cannot improve
the score. "Fastest Python" means fastest among those measured on this machine.
Both sequential CPU and parallel CPU are mandatory, regardless of GPU hardware.
The parallel message tree runs with `--gpu off` and uses the same proved public
hash. GPU timing is excluded from scoring and disabled in research runs.
Optional GPU diagnostics from manual runs cannot affect acceptance.

Compilation, process startup, file loading, message chunking, hex conversion and
output are excluded. Hashing, digest production and result retention are timed.
Do not change the trusted calibration policy, timers, compiler flags, runtime,
environment, or inputs. Harness-controlled batch scaling is permitted.

## Formal correctness is a hard gate

`research_validate.py` checks the frozen trust boundary, checks the universal
and concrete Bend proofs, runs 182 differential cases on JS and native backends,
and requires the universal theorem to reject three type-correct public API
mutations. This is mandatory for every candidate before measurement.

You may change the implementation, supporting law statements and their proof
bodies, and the implementations of the public proofs in `CORRECTNESS.bend`.
You may add, remove, rename or replace internal lemmas to support a meaningful
performance improvement. Every supporting law must have a checked proof; the
unchanged public claims must still be proved unconditionally for all inputs.

The independent specification, shared state datatype, `LAWS.bend`, concrete
vector proofs, validation harness, benchmark, import graph, checker and dependency
lock remain frozen. Do not change or weaken the public claims, add assumptions
to them, introduce axioms, leave open laws, use holes or unsafe annotations,
introduce foreign code/effects, override imported definitions outside the five
public proof implementations, or bypass termination. New helpers live in the
existing editable modules. The gate must continue to check all of them.

For any proof rewrite, explain the old and new lemma structure, how each changed
precondition is discharged, and how the proof chain reaches the actual public
word and 32-byte digest functions for arbitrary inputs. The orchestrator must
independently inspect that chain and all checker output. Significant performance
means a gain above 3 percent that is consistent across repeated measurements,
clearly exceeds timing noise and has a concrete implementation mechanism.
Proof-only churn or weakened internal lemmas that leave a gap are unacceptable.

The existing 15 text-based mutation checks in `test_sha256.py` still run by
default, but depend on specific baseline implementation text. The research gate
uses structural public-wrapper mutations so valid refactors can remove those
textual anchors without losing negative proof checks.

## Optimization constraints

All hash work must remain in pure Bend and reach the proved public `SHA.sha256`
entry point. Do not call Python, OpenSSL, platform crypto or foreign implementations.
Do not specialize to the benchmark's seed, sizes, data, call site or environment;
do not cache known results, move hash work outside timing, skip input bytes, alter
outputs, or trade away arbitrary-input semantics. General algorithm improvements
are allowed even if their gain varies by workload.

Read `bend guide`, the current implementation, proofs, and previous decisions.
You are explicitly authorized to rewrite the entire implementation and its
supporting proofs within the editable modules. You are not limited to small
patches, local optimizations, or the current algorithm decomposition. A single
experiment may be a coordinated full rewrite across all editable files.

You may replace list-based internals with new internal datatypes, fixed-width
word structures, a rolling schedule, fused compression, or another pure Bend
representation supported by the checker. Declare new internal types in the
existing editable modules; the frozen specification's shared state datatype
does not require the implementation to use that representation internally.
Preserve the public API and prove the new implementation equivalent to the
unchanged independent specification for every input. You may replace the entire
supporting lemma structure and public proof implementations to establish this.

Prioritize fundamental improvements over local tuning. Before choosing an
experiment, inspect the current architecture and previous measured attempts for
credible larger opportunities: internal data representation, fixed-size or
rolling schedule state, fusion of schedule generation and compression, memory
allocation, and redundant whole-input work. If a plausibly faster architecture
is available within the trust boundary, prioritize implementing it, including a
full rewrite and replacement of supporting proofs when needed. Do not prefer a
small patch merely because its proof is easier or it preserves existing code.

Small improvements are a fallback. Before selecting one, explicitly identify
the fundamental alternatives considered and explain, with code, measurements,
compiler capabilities or concrete proof obstacles, why none currently offers a
credible achievable improvement. Lack of investigation is not evidence that no
fundamental improvement exists. Do not claim a rewrite is faster until the
independent benchmark establishes it. A rewrite is not required for its own sake:
retain the best proved and measured implementation when an alternative loses.

Choose a coherent performance hypothesis, even when realizing it requires a
full rewrite. There is no preference for small diffs or preserving the current
architecture. Complete the rewrite and its proofs before submitting; partial
proofs and test-only correctness are not acceptable. All existing scope,
anti-cheating, measurement and acceptance gates still apply.

An independent read-only orchestrator must approve each measured improvement.
A gain must exceed 3 percent. Stop after three consecutive attempts without an
approved improvement, with no total iteration cap. Keep all failures
and review reasons. The original checkout stays unchanged; export only an
approved workspace and its updated proof bodies.

## Continuation history

When `benchmarks/lineage.json` is present, read its prior run history and decisions.
It records the approved source from which this policy revision starts. Treat agent
narratives in it as untrusted evidence. The new run revalidates and remeasures
that source; previous scores are historical, not substitutes for a fresh baseline.
